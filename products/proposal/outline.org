* Project description (1200 w)
** Prior research
Describe prior research, a comprehensible literature review of the research field, converging upon the research questions.

- Describe the state of affairs, including the theoretical framework, in the current research field based on the existing body of literature.
- Clarify how the previous research eventuates into the research questions of the current proposal

*** Content
- Description of what Symbolic Regression is
- Key benefits over other methods
  - Interpretable explicit models
    - Most common critique of ML
    - Still focused on predictive accuracy
    - Contrast with other ML techniques
    - Some other ML techniques 

  - Relevance in psychological contexts
    - Formal theories / modelling
    - Importance of exploratory research / abductive reasoning
    - How SR can be a tool to explore patterns in the data
 
- How symbolic regression is used
  - Hard to brute search

      - Recursive steps recovering physics-inspired properties from the net
    - cite:cranmer2020discovsymbol
      - They encode prior information in the structure of the neural networks
    - Better generalizability than just the DL algorithm.
    - This is /the state of the art/ in equation discovery

- Bayesian approach
  - Different method to encode prior information / structure
  - Not more demanding computationally than genetic or ML
  - Opens the door to model uncertainty
  - cite:jin2019bsr :: Linear combination of trees
    - Prediction focused
    - Restricted to linear combination of trees with normal residuals
    - Not really discovery of relationships (?)
    - But find "concise, informative, effective signals"
  - *But we can encode other structures that aren't necessarily linear combinations of trees*
    - As long as we assume a distribution over the residuals
  
** Key questions
Now state the key questions, the essence of the proposal. Here, the intended research should be connected to prior research. Testable hypotheses should be derived from the key question, and the relation between theory and research hypotheses should be clearly specified.

- Formulate a general relevant research question based on previous research.
- Translate the general research question in a clear manner into a specific research question.
- Translate the specific research questions into testable research hypotheses.

*** Content: Goals / objectives
- Implement Jin's Bayesian SR
  - No available implementation
  - Some possible modifications
    - 1 vs K trees
    - Different proposal distribution than the priors for \(\boldsymbol \Theta\).
  - Evaluate it's predictive accuracy against other methods
 
- Implement different versions of the Bayesian SR with other structure
  - Show how to incorporate structure into the Bayesian SR
  - Compare to the method of incorporating structure with DL

* Procedure (1000 w)
** Operationalization
- Operationalize the research questions in a clear manner into a research design/strategy. 
- Describe the procedures for conducting the research and collecting the data. 
- *For methodological and/or simulation projects describe the design of the simulation study.*
  
*** Content
- Implement Jin's Bayesian SR.
  - .... aaand compare performance with
    - K trees vs 1 tree
    - SR with genetic algorithms
    - SR + DL
    - Random trees, BART, ...?

- Compare with the DL + SR methods by
  - Particles that interact from cite:cranmer2020discovsymbol
    - Fitting ~Jin's Bayesian SR to the networks
    - Bayesian SR with structure to the data
      - Explain here how

** Sample characteristics
- In case of a simulation study, indicate how data will be generated.
  
*** Content
- For predictive comparisons... maybe some classical data sets and data generated from a collection of functions.
- For the comparison with DL use the same data as them.

** Data analysis
Indicate for each research question separately, how it is translated into a statistical prediction. For example: â€œIn a repeated measures ANOVA we expect an interaction effect of the between factor x and the within factor y on the dependent variable z. Also indicate how you will correct for multiple comparisons. Only the analyses proposed here can be described as confirmatory analyses in your research report. All other have to be mentioned as exploratory. 

*** Content
- RMSE + complexity (no. nodes / parameters)
- Difference from functions (real analysis?)
- ... and looking at the formulas

* Intended results (250 w)
Clarify what the implication of possible outcomes would be (per hypothesis) for the specific and general research questions as well as for the theory. Address the following in approximately 250 words:
- What are the interpretations if the results do match the expectations? 
- What are the interpretations if the results do not match the expectations?
- Are there any alternative interpretations?
- Is there any practical or societal relevance? Please explain.
*** Content
- If predictive performance is better with simpler equations... nice.
- If including structure into the Bayesian algorithm is better than recovering the structure from the biased DL approach... nice
* Work plan (500w)
** Time schedule
State the total amount of EC as noted in the internship contract (18-24 EC), 1EC stands for 28 hours work. Present and justify a time schedule in weeks, including your time investment in hours per week. Plan some spare time, and indicate what elements can be cut / reduced if necessary. Provide the intended presentation date.
*** Content
- 18 EC, 17h per week
- April ::
  - Working Jin's Bayesian SR
  - Compare performance with ez datasets
- May ::
  - Develop how to incorporate structure into the Bayesian algorithm.
  - Comparisons with the DL approach
- June ::
