- =simulation.jl= :: Runs the simulation study
  - Every 1000 MCMC steps it saves an unloads the current state of the chain, which is necessary to not run out of RAM
  - Output in =./splitchains/=
- =bindchains.jl= :: Binds the chain-chunks into proper =BayesianSR.Chain= objects
  - Output in =./chains/=
- =analysis.jl= :: Generates =output.jld2= with the simulation results
