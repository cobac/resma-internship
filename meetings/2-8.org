* To-do for the meeting
- Start using Julia
- Start implementing easy genetic sr
* Topics to discuss during the meeting
- What I have been doing (?)
  - Looking at how Julia works
  - Simple genetic algorithm to estimate polynomials
  - Only element-wise mutations
  - Works ok-ish (bad) for the higher degrees
  - Tried to use static-mutable arrays, but worse performance
- Things for next week,
  - possibly study transdimensional mcmc/bayesian sr
  - Implement tree genetic algo
