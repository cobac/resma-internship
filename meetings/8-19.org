* References format
- Title case for journals, sentence case for titles
- Just doi for pre-prints
* Abstract word count
* Model specification in main text
- Move details about hyperparaters used to the procedure section
- Re-check the wordyness, but I wouldn't want to sacrificy clarity for conciseness in this case
* Plots in standalone pages
- The text that references the main plots is 3 parragraphs
- No parragraph fits on the same page that a graph (except the example chains, but not in this order)
  - Or reduce their size...
- Combine plots (only acceptable original + simplify + multichain)
  - But inconsistent
