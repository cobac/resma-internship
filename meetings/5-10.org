* Things to discuss
** =lt()=
- Got a nice answer from one of the maintainers of =ExprRules.jl=.
  - https://github.com/sisl/ExprRules.jl/issues/32
  - No need to modify their code.
- Store =LinearCoef= on each linear operator node.
- =EqTree= becomes just a =RuleNode=.
- Modify tree prior to work with =lt()= nodes.
  - =tree_p()= and =growtree()=.
- Modifying / adding new tree util functions to work with =lt()= notes.
- Way of iterating through all linear operator nodes.
  - To update =a= and =b= on each proposal.
  - To get =a=s and =b=s into a vector to calculate probabilities.
** Ratio calculation
* TO-DO
** User facing functions
- Interface function
- Input validation
  - Datasets
  - Hyperparams (non-negative prior variances, etc)
  - Operators (no collisions with linear type etc)
- Output summary, statistics
