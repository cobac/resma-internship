* Topics to discuss

** Julia
- Environment into a package, Revise.jl
  - append! thing and all the quirks do work now
- Variables grammar 
  
** Select equation from a Bayesian approach
- I think they just select the last Expression after N iterations
- Seems a waste to only select one expression
- For prediction is not an issue because you can evaluate multiple expressions and get ranges
- But for equation discovery??
- Selecting the /best/ one will bias favoring more complex expressions
- Someway of combining trees?
- Uncertainty about trees?
- How is it done in other models with trans-dimensional jumps?
  
** Proposal outline
- Hard to think about all the stuff in advance
- Most decisions we can't make them yet
- Topics that seem nice but idk if it's going to make sense
  - Hyperparameters not included
- For now it's structured with 2 main goals
  - Implementing an testing performance of Bayesian SR
  - Show how to use Bayesian SR to incorporate structure, /inductive bias/.
- Schedule ::
  - Today proposal presentation
  - 3-12 (next Friday) written down with your feedback
  - Send out to peer review
  - 3-19 Final version with peer feedback
  - ... + and if we change our mind + your feedback
  - *Sign and submit by 3-25*
    
** Workflow for writing
- Feedback over a pdf?
- Issues tracker?
- Latex?
- Markup
  
** For next week
- Translate manual test into proper ones
- Write up the proposal
- Check [[https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/5/eaav6971][Other bayesian SR]]
- Tree modification functions... maybe not
  
* Notes
** Trees
- If there are similar structures a la linear models we could average
- The variance will determine
- Train-test
- In linears is doable because it's just add-not dependencies
** Stopping
** Parallellization
- the algorithm is inherently not parallellizable
- Population-genetic mcmc inter-chain proposals
** Comparisons
- RMSE/complexity
- Speed of convergence
- Interpretability
** Look at psychological forest
