* Things I've done
** Found/Fixed bugs
- Going through the whole program checking stuff with prints
** Checked the package with JET
- Some reports on =Parameters.jl= source, but clean in ours.
** Checked how they calculate transition probabilities
- Same as we do
** grow/prune issue
- Grow/prune share 1/3 of the probability of not keeping the tree
- p_grow = min(1, 8/(n_operators + 2))
  - 1 until n_operators = 7
- In that case p_prune = 0
- p_inv = 0, log(p_inv) = -Inf
- Numerator = -Inf
- Always reject sample
- Now, R is only not well-behaved when this happens
  - It's still Inf in other circumstances because of the exp()
