* Topics to discuss
** Research proposal
*** Approval on /Speedgrader/
*** I don't think we are going to be able to do everything
*** I'm still not convinced of the advantages of doing it /Bayesianly/
- Structure could be added with genetic algorithm too
** Done since last meeting
*** Translate manual test into proper ones
*** Code 
Doesn't feel very elegant.
Probably major refactors once the structure of the whole program is clearer.
****  Tree grows
-  \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) priors, depth of trees
**** Utility functions
- Rejection sampling
** I'm working on generating a tree proposal
*** Now crossroads about how to implement the whole thing
**** Sampling
***** Generate proposals from the whole chain
- With some kind of =step!()= function
- Keep track of last sampled tree on the Chain
***** Use a function that generates N samples
- Keeps track of the last trees on the state of the function
***** Other option... idk
**** Interface to the program
***** With a type?
***** Options in a function?

*** They use different (similar) movements
*** Main thing is that they calculate priors per operator
Meh 
* TO-DO for next week
** Keep coding
*** Hopefully all code to generate proposals
