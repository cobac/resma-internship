* Topics to discuss
** Revise
- When redefining a Struct Revise fails and I have to re-start the repl
** Want to change testing
- More properties focused, more labour
** All tree movements implemented
- Still need to implement proper testing
** I thought multiple movements, but just one
- Probabilities add to 1
** Delete movement
*** Infinite loop
- If no candidates, the probability of deleting is 0
*** I don't understand mutation sometimes
- Doesn't matter for the code because I'm reassigning everything but...
  
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :eval :session :results silent :exports code
  function delete_nothing!(node)
      # do stuff
      node = output
      return nothing
  end 

  function delete_node!(node)
      # do stuff
      node = output
      return node
  end 

  node = NewNode
  delete_nothing!(node) # Does not mutate node
  delete_node!(node) # Does not mutate node  
  node = dele_node!(node) # Works
#+END_SRC

But in other cases whatever happens inside a function mutates the arguments

** I think there is a bug in ExprRules.jl
- =node_depth()= and =get()=
- Need to try to reproduce it 

** DONE Bug with delete! and insert!

- Sometimes they don't change the size of the tree
- When the sampled node is root
- *Hacky solution related to the scope/mutation of arguments thing*

** Working on ratios of acceptance now
- =BigFloat= for likelihoods
- Need to refactor to calculate f(S) and q(S | S)

** Should start adding docstrings
- And possibly too some comments to the code
