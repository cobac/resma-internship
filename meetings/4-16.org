* Topics to discuss
** Revise
- When redefining a Struct, Revise fails and I have to re-start the repl
** Want to change testing
- More properties focused, more labour
** All tree movements implemented
- Still need to implement proper testing
** Delete movement Infinite loop
- If no candidates, the probability of deleting is 0
** I don't understand mutation sometimes
- Doesn't matter for the code because I'm reassigning everything but...
  
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :eval :session :results silent :exports code
  function delete_nothing!(node)
      # do stuff
      node = output
      return nothing
  end 

  function delete_node!(node)
      # do stuff
      node = output
      return node
  end 

  node = NewNode
  delete_nothing!(node) # Does not mutate node
  delete_node!(node) # Does not mutate node  
  node = dele_node!(node) # Works
#+END_SRC

- But in other cases whatever happens inside a function mutates the arguments
- So re-assigning one argument inside a function does not mutate whatever memory that argument is pointing to
  - It just points the argument to a new memory, but only inside the function (???)
- Problem with ExprRules.insert!() function when replacing root

** I think there are a few bugs in ExprRules.jl
- =node_depth()= and =get()=
- (and the insert! function that caused the mutation errors)
- Need to try to reproduce it
- All problems arise from how they define the NodeLoc type I think
  - I haven't thought of a better version of storing locations

** DONE Bug with delete! and insert!

- Sometimes they don't change the size of the tree
- When the sampled node is root
- /Non-elegant/ solution related to the scope/mutation of arguments thing

** Working on ratios of acceptance now
- =BigFloat= for likelihoods
- Need to refactor to calculate f(S) and q(S | S)
  - They are super complex??

** Should start adding docstrings
- And possibly too some comments to the code
