* Things to discuss
** Jin's code
- ...What a mess D:
- They include things in different parts
  - P(\sigma_{a|b}) in h()
  - P(\Theta) in f(\Theta|S)
*** Ratio calculation
**** No RJMCMC
- They don't use P(\Theta^{*})/P(\Theta) and they don't include in the paper equation
  - =codes/funcs.py:1284,1285=
  - They select only ~fStruc[0]~
- They don't use P(\Sigma^{*}_a)/P(\Sigma_b) and they don't include in the paper equation
  - They include it on the RJMCMC case with h()
- They *use* P(\Sigma_\varepsilon) but they *don't* include in the paper equation
**** RJMCMC
- They use P(\Sigma) correctly and they include in the paper equation
- They use P(\Theta) and they include it in the paper equation
**** Edge cases
- Shrinking from x to 0 linear operators
- Expanding from 0 linear operators
- I'm setting h()/h‚Å∫() = 0 for each the respective edge case
  - Like Jin
- They include the prior probability of variances that are not used
  - I don't
** State of the code
- Spaghetti
  - Works, so ok for now
  - If if works nicely I might rewrite it after the internship
  - ~1week
