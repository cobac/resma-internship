* Results
** Python
- A mess to run, on Friday they pushed an update to their README
- numpy overflow issues warning and dividing by 0 etc
  - I've assumed their script is dealing with those issues somehow, but I don't know how from the source code
- 2187x speedup
** Symbolic simplification / multichain
- All done!
  - It was a mess
- 88% of accepted simplifications
** Evolutionary
- They have a bug were the populations were not initialized properly
- On Friday they pushed a new symbolic backend
- Perform better /wider/ (more equations per population rather than more iterations)
*** Issue with how to calculate time
- Multiple populations (5)
- Each population multiple generations per iteration (300)
- Multiple iterations (2)
- With the current state of their code we only have access to time at iteration
  - 3 (2 iterated) time points per population 
  - 1000 equations per datapoint
  - Probably good enough?
*** Issue with for how long to run it
- Bayesian SR takes ~30/40s for each 100,000 samples
- No good performance in ~30/40s
- OK (but worse) with 150 samples
- Either algorithm gets to very low rmse with long running times
*** Broken JSON output
- Hall of fame works fine, but no info on time
- Only works properly for the first population
- Need to fix and re-run
** Showcase
- All methods very similar acceptance ratios
- I've neglected the complexity of the expressions
  - Only saving last
  - Should re-run the analysis to recover them
- If we select cummin we will be overfitting
  - In this case min(rmsd) is the original equation because there is noise
  - But that's not true in the real world
- Multichain helps a lot to explore the space / not get stuck
- Simplify step tends to get stuck more than the vanilla algorithm
  - Seems to be offsetted by multichain
- Overfitting in general
- Jin reporting?
  - No overfitting (not that much)
  - Graphs only 20/25 interations
  - Inconsistent
*** How to compare
- Not straightforward how to compare
  - Averages, cummin, etc
- Ideally report the change over time of the pareto frontier
- But no
* Repo to share
- Clean repo but leave history
