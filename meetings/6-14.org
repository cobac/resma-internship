* Delay
- Either drop the simplification step and crunch
- or ~2 weeks delay
* Multiple chains
- Works well
* Simplify
- I think it is the more interesting modification
  - Greatly reduces the posterior space
- Lot's of issues / edge-cases
  - Loose numbers
  - Non-binary structure
  - Symbols as function calls
  - Symbolics.jl creates new functions
  - + Combinations of all
* Datasets
- I checked rr98 and speed_acc on rtdists
- I don't think they are ideal (?)
- The only /accessible/ variables are speed and accuracy
  - + The discrete ones
  - Maybe it's interesting to plug the discrete ones as binary (?)
- Doesn't really capture the dynamics of the diffusion model
- But we could recover accuracy as a function of speed (?)
  - I'm not really familiar with the diffusion model, but I don't think it can collapse to that function(?)
