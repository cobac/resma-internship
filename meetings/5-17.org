* Things to discuss
** Jin's code
- https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg
** Acceptance ratio calculation
*** Standard MH
- On Jin's paper they don't use the probability of the LinearCoef
  - I understand not using the probability of jumping between coefficients
    - Because it is symmetric (or in this case just from the prior)
- But why not include the probability of each coefficient?
  
f(\Theta | S)

- They don't use either the probability of the variances (residuals + LinearCoef)
  - I had already included it in the ratio calculation without RJMCMC because I hadn't noticed they omit it 

p(\Sigma)

- Maybe I'm just misunderstanding the equations

** Type stability
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :eval :session :results silent :exports code
  @code_warntype BayesianSR.step(chain, 1, 1, verbose = false)
  # => Body::Union{Float64, BayesianSR.Sample}
#+END_SRC
- Why??
- If I force ~step(...)::Sample~, the warning disappears (as expected)
- No performance differences
- *FIXED:* =NaN= return when ~optimÎ²!~ failed.
- I believe all the program is type stable now.
** How to select best tree?
- Check change after n steps
** ExprBugs
- There weren't any bugs :D
  - Couldn't reproduce them
  - I misunderstood how mutation, scope, and assigning(=) worked before when I thought there were bugs.
- (apart from the insert! one)
