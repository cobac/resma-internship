* Things to discuss
** Jin's code
- https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg
** Acceptance ratio calculation
*** Standard MH
- On Jin's paper they don't use the probability of the LinearCoef
  - I understand not using the probability of jumping between coefficients because it is symmetric
  - But why not use the probability of each coefficient?
** How to select best tree?
- Check change after n steps
* TO-DO
* Notes
