* Things to discuss
** Jin's code
- https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg
** Acceptance ratio calculation
*** Standard MH
- On Jin's paper they don't use the probability of the LinearCoef
  - I understand not using the probability of jumping between coefficients because it is symmetric
  - But why not use the probability of each coefficient?
** Type stability
#+BEGIN_SRC julia :eval :session :results silent :exports code
  @code_warntype BayesianSR.step(chain, 1, 1, verbose = false)
  # => Body::Union{Float64, BayesianSR.Sample}
#+END_SRC
- Why??
- If I force ~step(...)::Sample~, the warning disappears (as expected)
- No performance differences
** How to select best tree?
- Check change after n steps
** ExprBugs
- There weren't any bugs :D
  - Couldn't reproduce them
  - I misunderstood how mutation, scope, and assigning(=) worked before when I thought there were bugs.
- (apart from the insert! one)
