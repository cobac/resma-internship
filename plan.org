* Notes
** Can be reuse tooling from...
*** Turing?
*** Flux?
*** ModelingToolkit.jl?
** Candidates to compare method
*** Bart
- Bayesiantrees::R
  - C++
- bartMachine::R
  - Java :|
*** non-bayesian Genetic algorithm
**** non-bayesian genetic algorithm with the linear operator
**** ExprOptimization.jl
**** ga R genetic package
  - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GA/index.html 
  - Look at the symbolic regression
**** evolutionary.jl
  - Do they support discrete parameters
**** Jump.jl
**** https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/16/eaay2631
*** Bayesian with only 1 tree
*** Estimate symbolic equation from neural nets
*** Proposal distributions during sampling different from the priors
** Differentiable programming to use the structure??
